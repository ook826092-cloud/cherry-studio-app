# Chat Input Behavior

This directory owns the Agent Session composer at the bottom of the chat surface. `ChatInput` is
exported through `index.ts` and receives the current `agentId` and optional `sessionId`.

## Current Contract

- An Agent selection owns an isolated Draft composer. Its first send uses `startSession`, which
  admits the message before atomically creating the Session and first message pair; observation and
  navigation begin only after that succeeds.
- Existing Sessions submit through the live `AgentProtocol` client owned by `ChatProvider`.
- The shared composer owns the draft, send recovery, keyboard behavior, and pasted attachment
  presentation. Draft and existing-Session composers use separate keyed sessions, so navigation
  cannot reuse one Session's draft in another.
- Image attachments are imported into managed storage before send. The Host revalidates their
  authoritative metadata, model capability, provider endpoint, and request limits before admission.
- While a turn is active, the send control becomes stop and calls `cancelTurn` for that Session.
- The resting composer is one row. Focusing it reveals the model pill and reasoning-effort gauge on
  the toolbar below without remounting the field, draft, or send control.
- Native media pickers and model/settings Sheets replace the live input context: the shared
  composer pins its dock, blurs the field, and settles keyboard dismissal before presenting them.
  It reconnects keyboard tracking only when the field receives focus again. Menu and effort
  overlays preserve the existing keyboard context instead.
- Picking a model updates the current Agent's `modelId`. Submission also snapshots the visible
  model so an immediate send cannot race the Agent mutation or query refresh. Rapid picks are
  persisted serially and coalesced to the latest visible selection.
- The reasoning gauge inherits the Agent setting until the user picks a value. A pick is local to
  the current Agent composer and is snapshotted into each submission; it never updates Agent
  configuration. An explicit `default` selection bypasses the Agent effort for that turn and uses
  the selected model's default.
- The composer menu stores web-search selection in the frontend persist cache, keyed by Session id.
  New Sessions default to enabled, and an admitted first send transfers the Draft selection to the
  returned Session. While enabled, every submission includes the turn-local `web-search`
  capability. The create-image mention remains turn-local and adds `image-generation` only to the
  draft that contains it. Neither choice mutates Agent or Agent Session persistence.
- Follow-up queues and steering are not part of the Version 1 Agent Session composer.
