// The message-tab lists (topics + drawings) sit above two mutually-exclusive
// bottom bars: the app tab bar at rest, and the selection toolbar in edit mode.
// Entering/leaving edit mode hides the tab bar and shows the toolbar (or vice
// versa). While the tab bar is hidden the native side re-measures its height to
// 0 (it becomes GONE on Android; iOS stops reporting), so if the list's bottom
// inset tracked `tabBarHeight` directly it would collapse on every edit⇄done and
// the content container would resize — a reflow that reads as a flash.
//
// We return ONE inset that clears whichever bar is showing and never changes
// across the toggle, so the list content stays put:
//   - `tabBarHeight` is latched to its last non-zero reading, so the transient 0
//     while the bar is hidden can't shrink the inset;
//   - we take the max of that and the toolbar's footprint so the same value
//     covers both states.
// Both terms are independent of `isEditing`, so callers can drop it from their
// contentContainerStyle memo and keep a stable style reference.
