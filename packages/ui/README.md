# UI Package

Shared Cherry Studio UI for the mobile app. This package owns product interaction
components and the mobile WebP runtime for the desktop UI icon set.

## Components

Runtime imports use the component-only entry point so Metro does not traverse the icon registries:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';
import PlusIcon from '@cherrystudio/app-icons/icons/plus';

<Button icon={<PlusIcon />} loading={isSaving} onPress={save} size="lg" variant="default">
  Save
</Button>;

<Button accessibilityLabel="Add" icon={<PlusIcon />} onPress={add} />;
```

`Image` wraps `expo-image` with Uniwind `className` support while preserving the underlying image
API.

`FilePreview` renders a business-neutral file descriptor and delegates presses to its caller. The caller supplies display
metadata, the file's kind, localized unavailable/opening labels, and an error callback; the
component owns the frame, the press target, unavailable states, and iOS Quick Look
thumbnail caching. Loading placeholders belong to the caller because it owns the loading lifecycle:

```tsx
<FilePreview
  file={{
    displayName: 'brief.pdf',
    extensionLabel: 'PDF',
    id: 'file-1',
    kind: 'pdf',
    revision: 4,
    uri: 'file:///documents/brief.pdf',
  }}
  labels={{ openWith: 'Open with', unavailable: 'Unavailable' }}
  onError={(error, operation) => reportPreviewError(error, operation)}
  onPress={openBrief}
/>;
```

Rendering is plugin-based and `kind` is an open set. CherryUI ships an `image` renderer and falls
back to the platform preview — an iOS Quick Look thumbnail, an Android extension card — for every
kind no plugin claims, so a caller may classify files more finely than any renderer handles.
`FilePreviewPluginProvider` registers renderers for the previews beneath it:

```tsx
// A module constant, because `plugins` is a memo dependency.
const previewPlugins = [{ component: PdfPreview, kind: 'pdf' }];

<FilePreviewPluginProvider plugins={previewPlugins}>
  <AttachmentGrid />
</FilePreviewPluginProvider>;
```

A plugin receives `FilePreviewComponentProps` — the file, the resolved size, and the same `onError`
— and draws the preview only. The frame and press target stay with `FilePreview`,
so a plugin cannot diverge on interaction. Providers nest: an inner one overrides the kinds it
names and inherits the rest, including the platform fallback.

The built-in table stays deliberately small. A renderer ships here only when it needs nothing
beyond `file.uri` and a platform API, as `image` and the iOS Quick Look thumbnail do. Anything that
parses a format or calls a service is product code and registers through the provider; see
`src/frontend/components/FileEntryPreview/README.md` for that path.

`openFilePreview` is the exported platform-opening primitive. The caller chooses when to use it
and handles its rejected promise. `onError` reports thumbnail failures; the shared operation type
also includes `open` for callers that use one error reporter for both operations. CherryUI carries no file database,
logging, or translation dependency.

`FileAttachmentPreview` is the compact horizontal result variant. It requires the same `onPress`
callback while showing a filename and caller-supplied category label; square
thumbnail callers continue to use `FilePreview`.

`FilePreview` has four explicit visual variants. The default `thumbnail` uses the plugin and
platform rendering described above. `icon` keeps image thumbnails but represents other files with
only their type icon, for rows that already show the filename. `attachment` puts a file-type icon
above a multiline filename on a compact neutral tile; `card` puts the filename first and the icon
at the bottom on a roomier surface. The `icon`, `attachment`, and `card` variants retain image
thumbnails and caller-controlled opening. An
optional `badge` slot sits beside the document icon or over an image; callers own its meaning and
localized content. Library cards show the complete filename so its type remains visible; compact
attachment tiles may omit the extension from the title while retaining the complete accessible
label and type metadata.

`file-preview/utils/file-presentation.ts` owns extension-to-icon routing and categorical theme
colors. Its icon choices follow desktop's `composer/tokenView/fileTokenPresentation.tsx`. The
file-specific adapters in `@cherrystudio/app-icons` retain the desktop Lucide 0.525.0 vector paths
where the current native Lucide version has renamed or redrawn them. They need no raster assets.

`MarkdownText` is the shared GitHub-flavored Markdown renderer. Static content uses the enriched
native renderer. A part that has streamed keeps the streaming renderer for its full mounted
lifetime, including terminal state, so completion does not remount its native subtree. Both receive
the same theme tokens, syntax palette, LaTeX flags, and typography scale. Native streaming mode ends
with each part, releasing pending tail blocks and requesting a final layout even when the text
itself is unchanged. Product code supplies the active font size step and decides how links open:

```tsx
<MarkdownText
  fontSizeStep={fontSizeStep}
  isStreaming={isStreaming}
  markdown={markdown}
  onLinkPress={openLink}
/>;
```

The enriched-renderer patch keeps overflowing tables horizontally scrollable across layout
updates and exposes native scroll indicators. Table cells do not open a copy menu; whole-message
copy stays with the message actions. Standalone code blocks have a 192-point maximum height,
including their header, in both native layout and shadow measurement. Short blocks keep their
natural height; longer blocks keep their complete content in a native vertical scroll viewport
with horizontal scrolling for long lines. The limit applies during streaming and after completion,
including reasoning and final answers. Code-pane drags use native scroll recognition and cancel
text long presses; Android gives an overflowing code pane priority over the outer message list
for that touch sequence. These behaviors are native and require a development-client rebuild
after changing the patch. The upstream `codeBlock` style has no `maxHeight` property; limiting
the outer Markdown view would constrain the whole message instead of each code block.

When rendering selectable content inside a scroll surface, follow the selection and
scroll-cancellation contract in
[Interaction And Gesture Arbitration](../../docs/references/interaction-and-gesture-arbitration.md)
and verify the native interaction boundary on each supported platform.

Typography utilities are exported from `@cherrystudio/ui/utils`: `normalizeFontSizeStep`,
`resolveTypographyScale`, and `createTypographyCSSVariables` keep native style objects, runtime CSS
variables, MessageList geometry, and settings previews on the same three-step scale.

`MessagePart` is the business-neutral visual family for structured chat content. It owns status
rows, reasoning and tool detail sheets, feedback blocks, source links, placeholders, translation
separators, unknown-part warnings, and structured detail sections. Product code supplies resolved
labels, states, content, and actions; CherryUI does not read message schemas, tool metadata,
translations, file identifiers, or application navigation:

```tsx
<MessagePart.Tool
  state="complete"
  statusText="3 results"
  title="Web search"
>
  <MessagePart.Source label="Cherry Studio" onPress={openSource} url="https://cherry-ai.com" />
</MessagePart.Tool>
```

`MessagePart.Process` is the inline disclosure used for one total-duration row before an answer.
The product adapter supplies its localized duration and every visible pre-result child; the
primitive owns the quiet divider, running shimmer, disclosure state, and compact chevron.

`MessagePart.Tool` and `MessagePart.Summary` accept `titleAnimation="none"` when adjacent content
already communicates live progress. The running state, status text, and detail action remain intact;
the default title animation is `shimmer`.

The native Storybook exposes these states under the dedicated top-level `Message Parts` section.
`Message Parts/Playground` collects every public message-part primitive and state on one interactive
page for visual debugging.
`MessagePart.Error` is the inline failure block. With `onPress` it reads as a button and opens a
caller-owned detail surface, typically `MessagePart.Detail` with text and value sections.

`MessagePart.Pending` owns the empty-response loader and its stable text-line height, while
`MessagePart.Reasoning state="running"` owns the active thinking row. Storybook groups both under
`Message Parts/Loading` for direct animation and theme inspection.

`Surface` is the semantic material boundary for shared product chrome. Callers choose a token-backed
`tone` and a `shape`, then size and align the content inside it. CherryUI maps that specification to
the complete non-glass fallback and, where supported, the matching Liquid Glass tint and radius:

```tsx
<Surface interactive shape="circle" tone="sidebar-accent">
  <Pressable className="size-11 items-center justify-center">...</Pressable>
</Surface>
```

Raw fallback classes, numeric radii, tint colors, and styles are private implementation details for
package components that need dynamic or animated geometry.

`ScrollToBottomButton` is a localized floating control for scrollable surfaces with a measured
bottom accessory. It owns the CherryUI surface, position, and visibility motion; the caller owns
the at-bottom state and the one-shot scroll action:

```tsx
<ScrollToBottomButton
  accessibilityLabel={t('chat.message.scrollToBottom')}
  bottomAccessoryHeight={composerHeight}
  gap={5}
  isAtBottom={isAtBottom}
  onPress={scrollToBottom}
/>;
```

`Alert` is the shared native dialog primitive. Mount one provider at the application root and
inject localized default action labels there; feature code can then enqueue informational,
confirmation, and prompt dialogs through `useAlert()` without owning dialog rendering:

```tsx
<Alert.Provider labels={{ cancel: t('common.cancel'), ok: t('common.ok') }}>
  <App />
</Alert.Provider>
```

The provider presents queued dialogs in request order. Confirmation and prompt actions close
without waiting for asynchronous business work, so failures can enqueue their own follow-up alert.
The standalone `<Alert>` primitive remains available for controlled dialog composition.

`Toast` is the shared gateway for temporary global notifications. Mount one provider at the
application root; feature code then shows notifications through `useToast()` without importing the
underlying toast library or mounting another host:

```tsx
<Toast.Provider>
  <App />
</Toast.Provider>

const { toast } = useToast();
toast.show({ label: 'Saved', variant: 'success' });
```

The gateway preserves the current four-second default duration and exposes `default`, `success`,
`warning`, and `danger` variants.

`Avatar` composes an image or fallback inside a clipped face while keeping badges outside that
clipping boundary. It accepts numeric sizes so product avatars can follow their surrounding layout,
and supports circular and rounded-square faces:

```tsx
<Avatar accessibilityLabel="OpenAI" shape="rounded" size={26}>
  <Avatar.Image contentFit="contain" scale={0.8125} source={source} />
  <Avatar.Badge placement="bottom-end">
    <StatusDot />
  </Avatar.Badge>
</Avatar>
```

Use `Avatar.Fallback` when no image is available. `Avatar.Image`, `Avatar.Fallback`, and
`Avatar.Badge` read the root size through context and must be nested directly inside `Avatar`.

`Button` is backed by React Native's `Pressable` on both iOS and Android. It supports `default`,
`destructive`, `outline`, `secondary`, `ghost`, and `link` variants, along with loading and disabled
behavior. `shape="pill"` selects a capsule without opening a styling escape hatch. The `xs`, `sm`,
`inline`, `default`, `field`, and `lg` sizes use content-driven typography and padding; `field` has a
minimum height that aligns with form controls while still growing for large text, and `inline` is a
compact zero-horizontal-padding action for headings or prose. The `icon` prop renders an icon before
the label and automatically switches to the matching icon-only padding when no label is provided.
Icon-only buttons must provide an `accessibilityLabel`. `Button.Label` remains available for custom
composed content. Callers do not need an Expo UI `Host`. The visually compact `xs` size supplies an
8-point hit slop by default so its effective touch target remains usable.

`Section.Header` owns its intrinsic row, typography, and minimum height. A header nested directly in
`Section` receives the grouped title inset from the root; a standalone header receives placement
from its immediate parent. `Section.Item` and its semantic row variants use `density="compact"`,
`"default"`, or `"comfortable"` for intrinsic vertical spacing.

`Section.RadioItem` is the controlled single-choice row. It owns the radio accessibility state,
selected checkmark, disclosure behavior, and leading-content inset; the caller owns the selected
value and persistence. The default grouped `Section` supplies its surface and separators. Use
`variant="plain"` for an edge-to-edge list without the grouped surface or separators:

```tsx
<Section>
  {options.map((option) => (
    <Section.RadioItem
      key={option.value}
      label={option.label}
      onPress={() => setValue(option.value)}
      selected={option.value === value}
    />
  ))}
</Section>
```

`Switch` and `Slider` keep one controlled CherryUI contract. Android and Web use Cherry-owned
controls with circular switch thumbs, thin slider tracks, and mobile touch targets. Their geometry
follows the desktop visual direction while colors use Mobile theme tokens. iOS retains its private
SwiftUI adapters. Feature code never imports a platform UI SDK or branches on the operating system.

`Section.SwitchItem` is the controlled setting row for one boolean action. The row is the only
press target and switch accessibility node; its trailing switch is a package-private visual
indicator. Use a separate `Switch` when the surrounding row also contains another action:

```tsx
<Section.SwitchItem
  label="Notifications"
  onValueChange={setNotificationsEnabled}
  value={notificationsEnabled}
/>
```

Use `Section.SelectItem` when a grouped settings row opens a picker. It standardizes the current
value, optional value icon, truncation, and down disclosure indicator. Use `SelectField` for the
same interaction in a standalone form, where it shares the border, field surface, height, disabled
state, and pressed feedback of other form controls:

```tsx
<Section.SelectItem label="Language" onPress={openLanguagePicker} value="English" />

<SelectField accessibilityLabel="Select model" onPress={openModelPicker}>
  <SelectField.Label>Model</SelectField.Label>
  <SelectField.Value>
    <ModelIcon />
    <SelectField.ValueText>Claude</SelectField.ValueText>
  </SelectField.Value>
</SelectField>
```

`OptionPickerBottomSheet` is the matching controlled single-choice surface. It renders an
edge-to-edge list of `Section.RadioItem` rows without separators, changes only a newly selected
value, and closes after any selection. The caller owns localized labels, the selected value, and
persistence:

```tsx
<OptionPickerBottomSheet
  onClose={closePicker}
  onValueChange={setLanguage}
  open={isPickerOpen}
  options={languages}
  selectedValue={language}
  size="compact"
  title="Language"
/>
```

`SelectionIndicator` is the decorative selected/unselected mark inside a parent checkbox or radio
row. The parent owns the accessible role, state, and press handling. Use its `overlay` variant when
the unselected ring sits on imagery and needs a dark contrast fill.

`Chip` has three explicit variants for compact metadata and filters. All three use quiet neutral
surfaces: the background is the lightest, the border is stronger, and the label has the highest
contrast. Selected chips strengthen the neutral background and border without introducing another
accent color. The semantic tokens adapt this hierarchy to light and dark themes.

```tsx
import { Chip } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';

<Chip.Removable
  onRemove={removeSearch}
  removeAccessibilityLabel="Remove Web search"
>
  Web search
</Chip.Removable>;

<Chip.Selectable selected={isReasoningEnabled} onSelectedChange={setIsReasoningEnabled}>
  Reasoning
</Chip.Selectable>;

<Chip.Tag>128k context</Chip.Tag>;
```

`Chip.Removable` keeps removal on its trailing close button, `Chip.Selectable` toggles when the
whole chip is pressed, and `Chip.Tag` is non-interactive. Selection and removal remain controlled by
the caller. Removal labels are required so the icon-only action can be localized and announced by
assistive technology.

`ContentState` is the platform-neutral Loading, Empty, and Error family for content surfaces. Its
explicit variants avoid boolean state combinations while sharing the content hierarchy, optional
icon, and up to two actions. Loading uses CherryUI `Spinner`; actions use CherryUI `Button`.
Product code keeps query state, retry behavior, list mounting, and localized copy:

```tsx
<ContentState.Error
  description={error.message}
  primaryAction={{ children: t('common.retry'), onPress: () => void refetch() }}
  title={t('common.loadFailed')}
/>;
```

Keep screen, list, composer, and card insets in the consuming feature and compose the state inside
that layout. Use `layout="centered"`, `layout="leading"`, or `layout="row"` for the state's internal
direction and alignment. `prominence="prominent"` raises the title and action hierarchy without
allocating any surrounding room. `ContentState` deliberately has no query, retry, inset, card, or
compact-mode props.

Shared components with text must be content-driven: avoid fixed width or height, keep React Native's
system font scaling enabled, and allow constrained labels to wrap. `Button` follows this rule by
using padding for its touch target and letting its label shrink and grow the container.

`TextAnimation.Rotating` cycles short, single-line phrases vertically while reserving the width of
the longest phrase, so surrounding content does not move between changes. Use the compound root to
share timing across animated values, or use the variant by itself:

```tsx
import { TextAnimation } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';
import { Text } from 'react-native';

<TextAnimation duration={2200}>
  <Text>Cherry Studio is </Text>
  <TextAnimation.Rotating
    text={['focused', 'fluid', 'yours']}
    textClassName="font-semibold text-primary"
  />
</TextAnimation>;
```

The variant respects Reduce Motion and `enabled={false}`. Its `className` styles the clipping
container; `textClassName` styles the phrases.

`TextField` is the provider-neutral field group for labels, descriptions, validation errors, and
shared disabled/invalid/required state. Use its compound members instead of importing loose field
typography primitives:

```tsx
<TextField disabled={isSaving} invalid={Boolean(errorMessage)} required>
  <TextField.Label>{label}</TextField.Label>
  <Input accessibilityLabel={label} onChangeText={setValue} value={value} />
  <TextField.Description>{hint}</TextField.Description>
  <TextField.Error>{errorMessage}</TextField.Error>
</TextField>
```

The component family owns its text presentation and maps neutral Cherry state to the private UI
provider. Product code should pass the same neutral state directly to an `Input` only when that
input needs to override the enclosing field.

`Input` is the shared field for ordinary and sensitive text. Set `type="password"` for passwords,
API keys, and other secrets; the password variant keeps the controlled value with the caller, owns
whether that value is revealed and where blurred content is displayed, and renders the visibility
action inside the field. Callers must provide localized action labels:

```tsx
import { Input } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';

<Input
  accessibilityLabel={t('settings.provider.apiService.apiKey')}
  onChangeText={setApiKey}
  type="password"
  value={apiKey}
  visibilityAccessibilityLabels={{
    hide: t('settings.provider.apiService.hideApiKeys'),
    show: t('settings.provider.apiService.showApiKeys'),
  }}
/>;
```

Password visibility starts hidden on every mount. Toggling keeps input focus by default; set
`blurOnVisibilityToggle` only when a consumer intentionally relies on blur to dismiss the keyboard
or commit its draft value. Blurred content is positioned at the start; focusing releases selection
control to the native input, including `selectTextOnFocus`. The password variant fixes `multiline`,
`secureTextEntry`, `selection`, `autoCapitalize`, and `autoCorrect`, while forwarding the remaining
compatible `Input` props. Its `style` prop targets the composed field container. Disabling the field
also disables its visibility action. Plain inputs default to `type="text"`, and their `style` prop
continues to target the native field.

`ActionMenu` and `ContextMenu` are the shared action menus. Each accepts one trigger element
and a flat, stable `items` array; the package owns presentation, action dispatch, and the
menu's recognition ownership. Call sites express which interaction they mean by choosing the
component instead of configuring a trigger:

```tsx
import {
  ActionMenu,
  ContextMenu,
  ContextMenuScrollBoundary,
  type MenuItem,
} from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';

const items = [
  { id: 'rename', label: 'Rename', onPress: rename },
  { destructive: true, id: 'delete', label: 'Delete', onPress: remove },
] satisfies readonly MenuItem[];

// A tap-triggered dropdown: the tap is button behavior the menu owns outright.
<ActionMenu items={items}>
  <MoreButton />
</ActionMenu>;

// A long-press contextual menu that keeps the child's normal tap behavior.
<ContextMenu items={items}>
  <MessageRow />
</ContextMenu>;

// The scroll owner exposes drag and momentum state to every descendant context menu.
<ContextMenuScrollBoundary>
  {(scrollHandlers) => <ScrollView {...scrollHandlers}>{rows}</ScrollView>}
</ContextMenuScrollBoundary>;
```

Item IDs must be unique within a menu. `checked` is controlled; omitting it creates a regular
action, while `false` and `true` create off and on check states. An empty array returns the child
unchanged. Android `ActionMenu` and `ContextMenu` share the composer add menu's surface, rounded
rows, expanding panel, and slide/blur/fade motion. Use these shared components for anchored action
lists throughout the app instead of adding another menu presentation. iOS retains native action
and context menus.

Android tap menus own one press target even when their trigger contains a `Button` or `Pressable`.
The child remains presentation-only; `disabled`, accessibility disabled state, and
`pointerEvents="none"` all disable the menu trigger. Long-press menus retain the child's ordinary
tap and accessibility actions.

The Android menus keep a 208-point width cap, wrapping labels, checkmarks, destructive text,
bounded scrolling, and safe-area positioning. They open above or below the trigger according to
available space. All Cherry-rendered menus, including `Composer.Menu`, use the same private
`MenuOverlay`, `MenuRow`, `MenuPanel`, and lifecycle hooks. The transparent system modal isolates
background accessibility, preserves the caller's theme/context, and owns Back/Escape. Opening
focuses the first item; dismissing without a selection restores the trigger's focus. A viewport
change dismisses the measured presentation instead of retaining a stale anchor.

Outside taps and system back close them; closing immediately disables item interaction and retains
the modal until its animation and native dismissal finish. Reduced motion skips the animation.
An enabled selection is accepted once and runs after native dismissal, so actions can safely open
a system picker or navigate; it does not restore old focus over the destination. Searchable pickers,
selection sheets, forms, and system media/share interfaces retain their own interaction contracts.
Expo Router page previews remain owned by `Link.Preview` / `Link.Menu`, not these components.

Wrap every scroll component containing an Android `ContextMenu` in one
`ContextMenuScrollBoundary`. The boundary supplies drag, momentum, and touch handlers through its
render callback without rendering another native view. Pass an existing scroll handler to the
boundary itself when it needs to be composed with menu arbitration. A touch that only stops
momentum stays ineligible for a context menu until that touch ends. On iOS the supplied handlers are
forwarded unchanged because UIKit already owns menu arbitration. On Android, a custom trigger
component must forward `accessibilityActions` and `onAccessibilityAction` to its accessible native
target.

`ContextMenu` recognition follows
[Interaction And Gesture Arbitration](../../docs/references/interaction-and-gesture-arbitration.md):
on iOS the system `UIContextMenuInteraction` owns the long press and its coordination with scroll
ancestors; on Android the long press is a `react-native-gesture-handler` recognizer in the shared
gesture arena, so committed scrolling and pan gestures cancel it. Its native view is only a system
configuration bridge with no menu items and never presents a popup. Recognition timing and touch
slop come from Android
`ViewConfiguration`, including the user's system long-press timeout. On Android the enabled items
are also exposed as accessibility custom actions on the trigger child, so the contextual operations
do not depend on long press; iOS accessibility stays with the system interaction. Verify changed
gesture boundaries on a device — the arbitration reference is `Status: design` and JavaScript tests
cannot prove recognizer timing.

The native implementation is adapted from MIT-licensed Nitro menu projects. See
[third-party-notices.md](third-party-notices.md) for the complete attribution and license text.

`BottomSheet` is the shared height-regulated mobile sheet. Its public API, ownership, dismissal,
height, nested-page, and platform behavior live in the colocated
[Bottom Sheet reference](./src/components/bottom-sheet/README.md).

`Composer` is a shared input surface: a text field that grows with its content and, under it, a
toolbar row. Nothing but the field is built in. It is fully controlled — the caller owns `value` —
and carries no i18n, attachment handling, or picking logic, so the same component backs a chat
screen, an image prompt, or a story.

```tsx
import { Composer } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';

<Composer
  labels={{ send: t('chat.input.action.sendMessage') }}
  onChangeText={setDraft}
  onSend={send}
  onStop={stop}
  placeholder={t('chat.inputPlaceholder')}
  streaming={isStreaming}
  value={draft}
/>;
```

That renders the default layout — the field, and a toolbar holding nothing but send. Pass `children`
to arrange the parts yourself and to fill the toolbar with your own tools:

```tsx
<Composer onChangeText={setDraft} onSend={send} value={draft}>
  <Composer.Input placeholder={t('chat.inputPlaceholder')} />
  <Composer.Toolbar>
    <Composer.Menu accessibilityLabel={t('chat.media.attach')}>
      <Composer.Menu.Item icon={<CameraIcon />} label={t('chat.media.camera')} onPress={openCamera} />
      <Composer.Menu.Item icon={<ImagesIcon />} label={t('chat.media.photos')} onPress={pickPhotos} />
    </Composer.Menu>
    <Composer.Action accessibilityLabel={t('model.select')} onPress={openModelPicker}>
      <SlidersHorizontalIcon className="size-6 text-foreground" />
    </Composer.Action>
    <Composer.Send />
  </Composer.Toolbar>
</Composer>;
```

Nothing is mandatory, sending included — the root does not check what you composed. Tools sit where
they are written and `Composer.Send` pins itself right, so adding one never moves the send button and
callers never need grouping views. `Composer.Action` is the button shell every tool should use: it
owns the circle, the 44pt slop, and the tint, so the row stays one size and one material no matter
who contributed a button to it.

`Composer.Dock` applies horizontal and safe-area insets and follows the keyboard. It floats above
screen content by default. Use `layoutMode="flow"` when the parent should reserve its space through
normal flex layout; this avoids measuring the dock back into React state. Pair the floating mode
with `useComposerDockLayout()` when content behind the dock needs the reserved inset, keyboard
offset, or shared live height used by another floating control:

```tsx
const dock = useComposerDockLayout();

<MessageList contentBottomInset={dock.contentBottomInset} renderMessage={renderMessage} />;
<Composer.Dock onHeightChange={dock.handleInputHeightChange}>
  <ComposerSurface />
</Composer.Dock>;
```

`getComposerActionCenterOffset(bottomInset)` exposes the toolbar action center's distance from the
screen bottom with the keyboard closed, so adjacent controls can align without duplicating composer
padding.

`Composer.Pill` is its wide sibling, for a tool that has to say what it is *set to* rather than only
what it does — the model in use, a mode. Same height and material, but sized to its label, and it is
the one thing in the row that can be arbitrarily wide, so it is also the one thing that gives: it
shrinks before the toolbar does. Its `icon` is held out of that on purpose, so a long model name
squeezes the text and not the logo.

State reaches the parts through context, so `<Composer.Send />` takes nothing. That context is split
in two — the state half changes on every keystroke, the actions half only when the caller's handlers
do — so a tool that merely acts keeps its identity while the user types. Sendability defaults to
"there is text"; pass `canSend` when it depends on something the composer cannot see, such as an
attachment the caller holds, an image model that has to be picked first, or a mode that needs no
prompt at all.

Only platform-divergent material and text metrics use `.ios` / `.android` files. Layout, state, and
collapse behavior stay shared. `Composer.Input` forwards every paste to `onPaste`; the caller decides
which payloads to use.

Rows above the field follow composition order rather than named slots. Use `Composer.Collapsible`
only when a conditional row should animate the surface height:

```tsx
<Composer.Collapsible>
  {isSearching ? <StatusPill label={t('chat.search.running')} /> : null}
</Composer.Collapsible>
```

The package deliberately ships no attachment strip; callers compose their own row and pass its
presence through `canSend`. `Composer.Menu` owns the add-button trigger and its morph. Its menu rows,
bounded scrolling, panel material, motion lifecycle, dismissal, and action dispatch are shared with
Android action/context menus. Labels wrap and grow with text size. Toggle rows own one accessible
switch action and render a private decorative indicator. `width` is a floor bounded by the viewport.
Panel radius comes from `rounded-4xl`; padding and row gaps belong to the panel, including when its
content scrolls. `useComposerMenu().close(afterClose)` can defer a composed action until dismissal.

## Motion

Curves and durations are two axes, exported separately from `@cherrystudio/ui/motion`:

```tsx
import { duration, easing } from '@cherrystudio/ui/motion';

translateX.set(withTiming(next, { duration: duration.base, easing: easing.settle }));
```

A curve is a design token — it means the same thing however far the thing travels — so components
share it. A duration is tuned to the distance, so components pick one. `easing.settle` is pure
deceleration and the right default for anything that moves or resizes something already on screen;
`easing.overshoot` is for something arriving out of nothing, where the overshoot *is* the arrival.

Components pair the two and name the pairing after the gesture rather than exporting a curve of their
own, which is what `composer.motion.ts` does. This vocabulary covers package components; app-local
easings remain outside it.

The host app must configure Uniwind, scan `packages/ui/src`, and provide the shared semantic color
tokens. This workspace does so in `src/frontend/styles/global.css`.

## Background Activities

`@cherrystudio/ui/background-activity` exposes the platform-neutral presentation model and a
registered icon union. Callers supply title, detail, compact label, optional preview, timing, and
one registered icon. They cannot supply children, render functions, arbitrary components, colors,
spacing, typography, or layout overrides. Feature services keep their phase and state machines and
map those values into this presentation model. `BackgroundActivityNativePresentation` adds the
theme and staged-logo fields used only by the host presenter; feature contracts do not expose them.

`@cherrystudio/ui/background-activity/ios` exposes the serializable `expo-widgets` renderer. It owns
the Lock Screen and Dynamic Island layouts, colors, type, spacing, truncation, compact timer/status, logo
placement, and SF Symbol mapping. Feature activity files only register that renderer under their
typed activity name. Infrastructure injects the resolved theme and staged logo and stamps terminal
time. Compact and banner surfaces show their timer when `compactLabel` is absent and replace the
timer with that short status when present. The banner presents `title` and optional `attribution` on its first
row, then the latest single-line `preview` with elapsed time on its second row. Overflow is truncated
from the head so the newest content remains visible.

The expanded surface repeats the title and attribution header, shows up to three lines of the latest
`preview`, and puts elapsed time at the lower trailing edge. When `compactLabel` is present, banner
and expanded timers both show that short status instead.

## Storybook

Stories are development-only assets outside the runtime source tree. Their ownership, structure,
application adapters, and commands live in the [Stories Guide](./stories/README.md).

## Icon Sync

The source icons are copied from the desktop repository's `packages/ui` package.

Synced source SVGs live in this package under:

```txt
packages/ui/icons/general
packages/ui/icons/providers/light
packages/ui/icons/providers/dark
packages/ui/icons/models/light
packages/ui/icons/models/dark
```

Generated WebP assets are consumed by the mobile app through static Metro
registries:

```txt
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/general/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/general/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/models/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/models/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/providers/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/providers/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/**/index.ts
```

The source SVGs under `packages/ui/icons` are conversion inputs only. Runtime
imports should come from the format-neutral `@cherrystudio/ui/icons` exports,
not from the source SVG or generated WebP directories.

Do not edit generated icons directly. Update the SVG source or the generator,
then run the relevant generator again.

## Generation

Run all icon generation from the app workspace root:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate
```

Scoped generation is also available:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate:general
pnpm ui:provider-icons:generate
pnpm ui:icons:generate:models
```

The WebP generator is:

```txt
packages/ui/src/scripts/generate-icons.ts
```

It renders general, model, and provider SVG sources to transparent 72px lossless
WebPs with `sharp`, writes light and dark assets under `src/icons-webp`, and generates static
`require()` registries for Metro. SVGs using `currentColor` are rendered as
theme foreground WebP pairs.

## WebP Runtime

Icons use static source pairs:

```ts
import { resolveIcon, resolveProviderIcon } from '@cherrystudio/ui/icons';

const icon = resolveIcon(modelId, providerId) ?? resolveProviderIcon(providerId);
const source = icon?.[theme];
```

Call sites pass the selected source to `expo-image`. Theme switching is handled
by choosing `light` or `dark` from the returned pair.

If a dark SVG does not exist, the generated dark WebP entry points to the light
WebP unless the source uses `currentColor`. This keeps the API stable while still
allowing later dark assets to be added without changing call sites.

Provider id aliases live in:

```txt
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/provider-aliases.ts
```

When adding a new provider id that differs from the source SVG name, add an
alias and extend `packages/ui/src/icons-webp/__tests__/providers.test.ts`.

## App Wiring

The app resolves `@cherrystudio/ui` through the workspace package and tsconfig
paths.

Generated icon directories are excluded from lint and format checks in
`.oxlintrc.json` and `.oxfmtrc.json`. Run those against hand-written package
files instead of generated icon output.

The model picker and settings pages render resolver output with `expo-image`.

## Validation

After syncing or changing icons, run:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test packages/ui/src/icons/__tests__/registry.test.ts packages/ui/src/icons-webp/__tests__/providers.test.ts --runInBand
pnpm exec oxlint packages/ui
pnpm exec oxfmt --check packages/ui
git diff --check
```

If the root app adds or removes the workspace dependency, also update
`pnpm-lock.yaml` with:

```sh
pnpm install --lockfile-only
```
