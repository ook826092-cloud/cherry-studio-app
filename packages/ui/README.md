# UI Package

Shared Cherry Studio UI for the mobile app. This package owns product interaction
components and the mobile WebP runtime for the desktop UI icon set.

## Components

Runtime imports use the component-only entry point so Metro does not traverse the icon registries:

```tsx
import { Button } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';
import { PlusIcon } from 'lucide-uniwind/png';

<Button icon={<PlusIcon />} loading={isSaving} onPress={save} size="lg" variant="default">
  Save
</Button>;

<Button accessibilityLabel="Add" icon={<PlusIcon />} onPress={add} />;
```

`Button` is backed by React Native's `Pressable` on both iOS and Android. It supports `default`,
`destructive`, `outline`, `secondary`, and `ghost` variants, along with loading and disabled
behavior. The `sm`, `default`, and `lg` sizes use content-driven typography and padding without
fixed dimensions. The `icon` prop renders an icon before the label and automatically switches to
the matching icon-only padding when no label is provided. Icon-only buttons must provide an
`accessibilityLabel`. `Button.Label` remains available for custom composed content. Callers do not
need an Expo UI `Host`.

Shared components with text must be content-driven: avoid fixed width or height, keep React Native's
system font scaling enabled, and allow constrained labels to wrap. `Button` follows this rule by
using padding for its touch target and letting its label shrink and grow the container.

The host app must configure Uniwind, scan `packages/ui/src`, and provide the shared semantic color
tokens. This workspace does so in `src/frontend/styles/global.css`.

## Storybook

Stories are development-only assets kept outside the runtime source tree, matching the desktop UI
package structure:

```txt
packages/ui/stories/components/primitives/button.stories.tsx
```

Run the native Storybook entry with:

```sh
pnpm storybook
```

The command opens Storybook in Expo Go, keeping it isolated from the Cherry Studio development
client. Use `pnpm storybook:clear` after changing Storybook or Metro configuration. Storybook is
enabled by entry-point swapping, so the normal Expo entry and production bundles do not import it.

## Icon Sync

The source icons are copied from the desktop repository's `packages/ui` package.

Synced source SVGs live in this package under:

```txt
packages/ui/icons/general
packages/ui/icons/providers/light
packages/ui/icons/providers/dark
packages/ui/icons/models/light
packages/ui/icons/models/dark
```

Generated WebP assets are consumed by the mobile app through static Metro
registries:

```txt
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/general/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/general/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/models/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/models/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/providers/light
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/providers/dark
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/**/index.ts
```

The source SVGs under `packages/ui/icons` are conversion inputs only. Runtime
imports should come from the format-neutral `@cherrystudio/ui/icons` exports,
not from the source SVG or generated WebP directories.

Do not edit generated icons directly. Update the SVG source or the generator,
then run the relevant generator again.

## Generation

Run all icon generation from the app workspace root:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate
```

Scoped generation is also available:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate:general
pnpm ui:provider-icons:generate
pnpm ui:icons:generate:models
```

The WebP generator is:

```txt
packages/ui/src/scripts/generate-icons.ts
```

It renders general, model, and provider SVG sources to transparent 72px lossless
WebPs with `sharp`, writes light and dark assets under `src/icons-webp`, and generates static
`require()` registries for Metro. SVGs using `currentColor` are rendered as
theme foreground WebP pairs.

Current generated counts:

- General icons: 22
- Provider icons: 156
- Model icons: 168

## WebP Runtime

Icons use static source pairs:

```ts
import { resolveIcon, resolveProviderIcon } from '@cherrystudio/ui/icons';

const icon = resolveIcon(modelId, providerId) ?? resolveProviderIcon(providerId);
const source = icon?.[theme];
```

Call sites pass the selected source to `expo-image`. Theme switching is handled
by choosing `light` or `dark` from the returned pair.

If a dark SVG does not exist, the generated dark WebP entry points to the light
WebP unless the source uses `currentColor`. This keeps the API stable while still
allowing later dark assets to be added without changing call sites.

Provider id aliases live in:

```txt
packages/ui/src/icons-webp/provider-aliases.ts
```

When adding a new provider id that differs from the source SVG name, add an
alias and extend `packages/ui/src/icons-webp/__tests__/providers.test.ts`.

## App Wiring

The app resolves `@cherrystudio/ui` through the workspace package and tsconfig
paths.

Generated icon directories are excluded from lint and format checks in
`.oxlintrc.json` and `.oxfmtrc.json`. Run those against hand-written package
files instead of generated icon output.

The model picker and settings pages render resolver output with `expo-image`.

## Validation

After syncing or changing icons, run:

```sh
pnpm ui:icons:generate
pnpm typecheck
pnpm test packages/ui/src/icons/__tests__/registry.test.ts packages/ui/src/icons-webp/__tests__/providers.test.ts --runInBand
pnpm exec oxlint packages/ui
pnpm exec oxfmt --check packages/ui
git diff --check
```

If the root app adds or removes the workspace dependency, also update
`pnpm-lock.yaml` with:

```sh
pnpm install --lockfile-only
```
