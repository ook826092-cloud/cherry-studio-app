# Cherry Agent Runtime

Status: **Pi Runtime active behind the Mobile Agent Host**; the tool contract shapes
(`RuntimeToolRef`, `RuntimeToolResult`, the `interrupted` tool state) are settled design landing
with tool configuration. Version 1 is local-only.

The Agent Runtime is the independent execution boundary behind the Mobile Agent Host. Pi is the
only local implementation. AI SDK may remain an implementation detail of non-conversation
model-capability services called through application-owned tools, but it is not an Agent Runtime and
does not own conversation or tool-loop state.

## Dependency rule

```text
Mobile Agent Host
    ↕ Agent Runtime contract
Pi Runtime
    ↕ RuntimeTool callback
Application capability adapter → device / MCP / AI SDK / managed files
```

The Runtime knows prepared prompts, models, history, tools, input, and normalized execution events.
It does not know Cherry Agent or Session entities, application commands or snapshots, SQLite,
Data API, React, Expo, navigation, or UI state.

The Host is the only adapter between the [Agent Protocol](./agent-protocol.md) and the Runtime. It
loads application data, validates the local execution target, constructs the request, maps events,
and persists the result.

Runtime independence is enforced by imports and conformance, not by checking the directory name.
Promotion to a workspace package happens only when a real independent consumer exists.

## Local execution binding

Version 1 accepts only the `local` execution target. Application composition injects one Pi Runtime
directly into the Host. There is no Runtime registry, no implementation-selection Router, and no
persisted Runtime binding. Agent configuration, Session configuration, model selection, and tool
availability never select another local engine.

The Agent's application-owned instructions, model, tools, and enabled Mobile Skills are resolved
afresh for every turn. The Host prepares instruction context from only the Skills selected by the
current Agent configuration. A Skill is never itself a tool; its exact loading and history behavior
remain deferred. The injected Pi Runtime remains stable for the Host lifetime.

## Production Pi binding

The production Host binds `local` directly to Pi and injects provider/model resolution through an
application adapter. The Runtime itself imports neither Expo transport nor application data
services. Current provider coverage is intentionally narrow: API-key-authenticated OpenAI Responses
endpoints. Unsupported endpoint or authentication types fail before partial execution; expanding
that adapter is follow-up work.

Pi receives the complete structured transcript and Agent inference options on each execution. It
maps text, reasoning, tool parts, approvals, cancellation, normalized failures, and cumulative
multi-call usage onto this contract. The Runtime tool loop is implemented, but the Host currently
supplies `tools: []` until the application-owned tool configuration model lands. Attachments remain
disabled pending Host-side file resolution.

## Descriptor and lifecycle

```ts
type RuntimeDescriptor = {
  id: string
  name: string
  capabilities: RuntimeCapabilities
}

type RuntimeCapabilities = {
  reasoning: boolean
  tools: boolean
  approvals: boolean
  attachments: boolean
}

interface AgentRuntime {
  readonly descriptor: RuntimeDescriptor
  open(): Promise<AgentRuntimeSession>
}

interface AgentRuntimeSession {
  execute(request: RuntimeExecutionRequest): AsyncIterable<RuntimeEvent>
  cancel(turnId: string): Promise<void>
  respondApproval(input: {
    turnId: string
    approvalId: string
    decision: 'approve' | 'deny'
  }): Promise<void>
  close(): Promise<void>
}
```

Capabilities describe what the engine contract can represent. In particular, `tools: true` means
Pi can run a tool loop; it does not mean the current Agent has any tools configured. The Host derives
the effective tools for each turn, and the Pi model adapter separately checks whether the selected
model supports native tool calling.

The Host owns one `AgentRuntimeSession` for each active application Session. The Runtime session may
hold provider clients and execution-local state, but every `execute` request contains the complete
normalized context required for that turn.

`cancel` and `close` are required and idempotent. Version 1 permits only one active `execute` call
per Runtime session.

## Execution input

```ts
type RuntimeJsonValue =
  | null
  | boolean
  | number
  | string
  | RuntimeJsonValue[]
  | { [key: string]: RuntimeJsonValue }

type RuntimeToolRef =
  | { source: 'builtin'; capabilityId: string }
  | { source: 'mcp'; serverId: string; rawToolName: string }

type RuntimeArtifact = {
  ref: { kind: 'managed-file'; fileEntryId: string }
  mediaType: string
  name: string
  kind: 'created' | 'derived'
}

type RuntimeToolResult = {
  value: RuntimeJsonValue
  artifacts: RuntimeArtifact[]
}

type RuntimeExecutionRequest = {
  turnId: string
  instructions: string
  model: RuntimeModel
  history: RuntimeMessage[]
  input: RuntimeInputPart[]
  tools: RuntimeTool[]
  options: RuntimeOptions
}

type RuntimeModel = {
  providerId: string
  modelId: string
}

type RuntimeOptions = {
  reasoningEffort?: 'off' | 'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'xhigh' | 'max'
  maxOutputTokens?: number
  temperature?: number
}

type RuntimeInputPart =
  | { type: 'text'; text: string }
  | { type: 'file'; mediaType: string; name?: string; uri: string }
```

Runtime implementations receive model/provider dependencies from application composition. They do
not query Cherry provider or model tables.

The Host resolves protocol-level turn snapshots before this boundary. `default` and the current Pi
`auto` fallback become an absent `reasoningEffort`, while `none` becomes `off`; Runtime
implementations therefore receive only an executable effort level.

File input is resolved by the Host before it reaches a Runtime: attachments enter the application's
file storage first, `AgentInputPart` carries the resulting `fileEntryId`, and the Host validates and
converts that entry into a directly consumable `uri` (such as a data URL). A Runtime never reads the
device filesystem; until the Host-side resolution step lands (owned separately), local Runtimes
declare `attachments: false` and reject file parts before partial execution. Tool-side access
follows the stricter managed-id ledger in
[Agent Tools And Controlled Resources](./agent-tools-and-resources.md#controlled-file-ledger).

### History

```ts
type RuntimeMessage = {
  role: 'user' | 'assistant' | 'system'
  parts: RuntimeMessagePart[]
}

type RuntimeMessagePart =
  | { type: 'text' | 'reasoning'; text: string }
  | { type: 'file'; mediaType: string; name?: string; uri: string }
  | {
      type: 'tool-call'
      toolCallId: string
      toolRef: RuntimeToolRef
      providerName: string
      input: RuntimeJsonValue
    }
  | {
      type: 'tool-result'
      toolCallId: string
      output: RuntimeToolResult
      isError: boolean
    }
```

The Host converts persisted Cherry messages into this normalized history. Runtime-native messages
never become the application source of truth. User attachment parts may become Runtime file parts;
assistant artifact parts remain application-visible managed references and are not automatically
inlined into model history. Pi accesses their content only through a controlled read/inspect tool or
after the user explicitly attaches the managed entry again.

Text parts may contain Markdown, but the history is never flattened into one Markdown document.
Tool calls and results remain structured and paired by `toolCallId`; Pi needs those records to
continue a tool loop and to reconstruct later turns correctly.

### Tools

```ts
type RuntimeTool = {
  ref: RuntimeToolRef
  providerName: string
  displayName: string
  description: string
  inputSchema: RuntimeJsonValue
  approval: 'auto' | 'ask' | 'deny'
  execute(
    input: RuntimeJsonValue,
    context: { signal: AbortSignal; toolCallId: string },
  ): Promise<RuntimeToolResult>
}
```

`ref` is the stable application identity used by binding, approval, persistence, and audit.
`providerName` is only the deterministic function alias exposed to the model for this contract;
`displayName` is a historical UI snapshot. `inputSchema` is portable JSON Schema, not a
provider-native schema object.

The Host supplies an immutable tool snapshot after applying current Agent configuration, platform
availability, system permissions, and Agent policy. Configuration changes during execution apply to
the next turn, not the active one. A Runtime validates tool input, enforces the approval mode, and
invokes `execute` only after approval when the mode is `ask`.

`tools: []` is a complete and valid request: Pi performs ordinary conversation and the Host must not
leave stale tool instructions in the prompt. A non-empty snapshot enables Pi's model → tool → result
→ model loop. A call to a name absent from the snapshot fails closed with a normalized unavailable
tool result; a Runtime never looks up and executes an arbitrary application tool dynamically.

Tool configuration, OS permission, and execution approval are separate gates. A configured tool is
not automatically approved. If the snapshot is non-empty but the selected model cannot call tools,
the Pi Runtime rejects the turn with a normalized unsupported-tools failure before partial execution
instead of silently degrading to prompt-encoded pseudo calls.

When a tool call is denied — approval mode `deny`, or an `ask` approval resolved as deny — the
Runtime never invokes `execute`. It reports the tool part as `denied`, persists
`{ "value": { "status": "denied", "reason": "..." }, "artifacts": [] }` as its output, and
returns that envelope to the model as the call's result, so the loop continues without the tool
running. This feedback shape is a cross-implementation rule.

Runtime-generated failures use the same outer envelope. An `error` result uses
`value: { status: 'error', error: { code, message, retryable } }`; an `interrupted` result uses
`value: { status: 'interrupted', reason: '...' }`; both use `artifacts: []`. Startup reconciliation
uses that interrupted shape as well. Native errors, stack traces, and late callback results never
enter these envelopes.

Tool callbacks and `AbortSignal` are allowed here because the Runtime contract is process-local.
They never cross the JSON-safe application protocol.

A callback may close over a narrow application capability service. This is how Streamable HTTP MCP,
calendar, Office generation, image generation, and managed-file operations reach Pi without Pi
importing application or provider SDK modules. Image generation may use `AiService`,
`@cherrystudio/ai-core`, or AI SDK behind that callback; those dependencies still do not own the
conversation or tool loop.

Every callback returns `RuntimeToolResult`. A non-artifact tool returns `artifacts: []`; an MCP
adapter wraps the remote payload in `value` and never interprets its shape as an artifact envelope.
A file-producing application capability creates and validates each managed entry before returning
its artifact ref. The Pi adapter gives the model the typed outer envelope, including bounded managed
refs but never artifact bytes, and also emits the artifacts as Runtime file parts for Host
projection. This preserves same-turn follow-up access without treating assistant artifact parts as
later model attachments. See
[Agent Tools And Controlled Resources](./agent-tools-and-resources.md#tool-results-and-artifacts).
Absolute paths and large base64 payloads are never tool results.

Mobile Skills are resolved by the Host from the current Agent configuration. They never become
executable capabilities and cannot change the tool snapshot, approval policy, OS permission, or
turn resource ledger. Their eventual loading and prompt projection are defined with implementation.
See [Agent Skills](./agent-skills.md).

      input?: RuntimeJsonValue
      output?: RuntimeToolResult

      error?: RuntimeError
    }

type RuntimeApproval = {

  status: 'pending' | 'approved' | 'denied'

}

type RuntimeUsageContext = Omit<AiUsageCaptureContext, 'source' | 'messageRef'>

type RuntimeError = {
  code: string
  message: string
  retryable: boolean
}
```

Every execution emits exactly one terminal event: `completed`, `failed`, or `cancelled`. Before a
terminal event, the Runtime settles every live tool part: denial includes the canonical denial
output envelope, tool failure includes a normalized error result envelope, and cancellation replaces
unfinished tool parts with `interrupted` and a normalized result envelope. No event may follow the
terminal event. Runtime-native errors are normalized and must not expose credentials or stack
traces.

`usage` values are cumulative for the execution; the last report before the terminal event is
authoritative. Detailed cache and reasoning counts remain available for pricing even though the
Agent Protocol message projects only the input, output, and total counts. `context` is the immutable
provider, served-model, pricing, and credential-attribution snapshot captured when the provider is
resolved, before execution starts. `completedAt` is recorded at the Runtime provider boundary. The
Host adds the Agent source and Session message reference without re-reading mutable provider/model
configuration. It does not synthesize provider timing from the broader Host turn lifetime. A
Runtime that cannot report usage emits no `usage` event, and the assistant message's protocol
`usage` stays `null`.

## Host execution flow

1. The Host validates that the Session is idle.
2. It persists the user message and assistant placeholder.
3. It validates that the Session target is `local` and resolves the current Agent configuration.
4. The Host uses its injected Pi Runtime.
5. The Host resolves enabled Mobile Skills, creates the turn resource ledger, and normalizes
   instructions, model, structured history, the immutable tool snapshot, input, and options.
6. The selected Runtime executes the prepared request.
7. The Host maps Runtime parts, approvals, usage, and terminal events into Agent Protocol state.
8. Terminal message and turn state commit before the Host publishes terminal protocol events.

The Runtime never writes application storage. The Host never interprets Pi-native events outside
the Pi implementation.

## Execution lifetime

Route unmount does not own or cancel execution; the app-owned Host and Runtime session do. A
foreground transition creates a fresh protocol observation from the Host snapshot.

Local execution depends on the Mobile JavaScript process. If the process is suspended or killed and
the turn cannot reach a terminal event, startup reconciliation marks the persisted placeholder and
turn as interrupted and terminalizes every non-terminal persisted tool part as `interrupted`.
Version 1 has no resume API or background-execution guarantee.

History projection never sends an unanswered approval or another dangling tool call to Pi. A
persisted `denied`, `error`, or `interrupted` tool part contributes its paired normalized tool result;
an abandoned incomplete call without a durable result is omitted as a whole. This follows the PC
Agent invariant while keeping Mobile Version 1 non-resumable.

## Conformance

Every Runtime implementation passes the same suite:

1. Descriptor id and capabilities are stable.
2. A valid request reaches exactly one terminal event.
3. No output follows a terminal event.
4. Text deltas and part replacements address existing stable part ids.
5. Unsupported input or tools fail before partial execution.
6. `cancel` is idempotent and causes the active turn to settle as cancelled.
7. Approval is requested only for an `ask` tool and correlates to the active turn and tool call.
8. Denied tools are never executed and still produce a paired canonical result.
9. `close` is idempotent and releases provider, iterator, and tool resources.
10. Native errors are normalized without secrets or stack traces.
11. The implementation imports no application protocol, persistence, React, or Expo module.
12. Tool refs remain stable when display names or provider aliases change.
13. Artifact output contains validated managed refs, never absolute paths or unbounded inline bytes.
14. Cancellation and startup recovery leave no non-terminal tool part or dangling model-history call.
15. Skills cannot become executable capabilities or expand a turn's tool snapshot or resource ledger.

The production conformance target is the Pi Runtime. A fake Runtime exercises Host behavior without
Pi or a provider connection.
