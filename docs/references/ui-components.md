# UI Components

This reference defines what is true about shared components in Cherry Studio Mobile: who owns each
surface, and where a platform difference is legitimate. [UI Development](../guides/ui-development.md)
defines how to do the work — searching CherryUI first, composing component APIs, and promoting a
feature component into the package.

## The Platform Rule

One rule governs every platform decision:

> Respect a platform difference the platform imposes. Do not introduce one it does not.

A difference is **imposed** when the operating system, a native API, a system-rendered surface, or
the platform bundle requires it: the shared source cannot express the behavior, or expressing it in
shared source would be incorrect. Imposed differences are respected in full, including the system's
own appearance, gestures, and accessibility behavior. Reproducing a system surface in JavaScript to
keep the source uniform is a worse outcome than splitting it.

A difference is **chosen** when shared source could express it correctly and the argument for
splitting is that one platform's result would look or feel more conventional. Chosen differences are
not introduced. Cherry Studio has one product identity across iOS and Android; platform design
conventions are input to the design, not a reason to maintain separate Cupertino and Material
component families.

The test is whether the shared implementation would be *wrong*, not whether it would be
*unfamiliar*. Ordinary product components have no imposed difference and do not fork.

### Decision Order

1. If the operating system or a provider renders the surface, expose a shared gateway and let the
   platform render it, including its native appearance and gestures.
2. If a native API, lifecycle, or bundling constraint cannot be represented safely in shared source,
   split only the private adapter and preserve the shared product contract.
3. If only a value, callback, or system behavior differs, keep one implementation and adapt the
   difference behind the component or navigation boundary.
4. Otherwise, use one shared implementation.

An import unavailable on the other platform, or one that would unnecessarily place a platform SDK in
the other platform's bundle, satisfies step 2. Color, spacing, radius, typography, shadow, and
product-control geometry never do.

Splitting under step 1 or step 2 changes neither the shared public API nor the product
specification; only the private adapter differs. A component may also use a React Native or
maintained third-party primitive internally, provided that dependency preserves the shared contract
and does not force feature code to branch by platform.

### Applying The Rule

Platform files follow [Platform Variants](./naming-conventions.md#platform-variants) and stay inside
the smallest component or gateway family that owns the difference. The dependency direction is:

```text
product screen or feature
        ↓
shared CherryUI component or semantic platform gateway
        ↓
private iOS / Android adapter when required
        ↓
operating-system or provider API
```

Existing `.ios.tsx` and `.android.tsx` files are implementation inventory, not precedent. Reassess
their boundary when substantially changing the component, but do not migrate unrelated components
incidentally.

### Component Family Anatomy

A component family is the smallest directory that owns one public product component, its public
types, private implementation helpers, and tests. A platform split does not create multiple public
components. When the public component owns shared behavior and only the rendered primitive differs,
use a shared shell with a private adapter:

```text
switch/
├── index.ts                    public exports only
├── switch.tsx                 shared behavior, events, and composition
├── switch.types.ts            public product contract
├── switch-control.types.ts    private adapter props shared by every implementation
├── switch-control.tsx         extensionless fallback for Web and tooling
├── switch-control.ios.tsx     iOS provider or system primitive
├── switch-control.android.tsx Android provider or system primitive
└── switch-indicator.tsx       private shared implementation helper
```

`Switch` is the public component. `SwitchControl` is an implementation port: the smallest interface
through which the shared component delegates to a platform implementation. It is never exported
from a package barrel or imported by product code.

The shell owns product semantics such as controlled state, event ownership, accessibility defaults,
shared layout, product styling, and composition. The adapter owns only the platform-imposed
rendering or API mapping and uses one common props type. Provider SDK types stop at that adapter
boundary.

Here, extensionless means that the module stem has no `.ios` or `.android` suffix; the physical file
still has its normal `.ts` or `.tsx` extension. The extensionless adapter is a supported fallback,
not a placeholder. Metro selects `.ios` or `.android` on native platforms; Web, tests that explicitly
request the base module, and tools without platform resolution use the extensionless file. A family
may have only one platform-specific file when only one platform imposes a difference, but it still
keeps the extensionless fallback and shared adapter props.

Do not introduce this shell-and-adapter shape when the whole component is already correct in shared
source. If the complete public component is inherently platform-owned and has no meaningful shared
behavior to retain, a direct platform family may be smaller. In both shapes, product code imports the
same public component and never selects a platform implementation itself.

A direct platform family keeps the public component name in each implementation:

```text
tabs/
├── index.ts          public exports only
├── tabs.types.ts     public contract shared by every implementation
├── tabs.tsx          extensionless fallback for Web and tooling
├── tabs.ios.tsx      complete iOS component
└── tabs.android.tsx  complete Android component
```

Use this second shape only when there is no shared shell behavior to preserve. Its fallback, explicit
platform tests, and public-only barrel follow the same rules as the adapter family.

## Ownership

`@cherrystudio/ui/components` is the public entry point for reusable, platform-neutral product
interaction components. Its [package README](../../packages/ui/README.md) is the component API
reference and the authority on what the package currently provides.

Runtime component imports use that entry point so Metro does not traverse icon registries:

```tsx
import { Button, Section, TextField } from '@cherrystudio/ui/components';
```

`@cherrystudio/app-icons` owns the Lucide SVG/Uniwind adapter. Runtime icons use default deep
imports such as `@cherrystudio/app-icons/icons/check`; its package root exports icon types only so
Metro does not traverse the full Lucide set. Feature code owns business state,
translations, query behavior, and workflow-specific composition. A local `Pressable` wrapper is
appropriate only while its interaction remains specific to that feature; repeated product
interaction behavior moves into CherryUI through the workflow in
[UI Development](../guides/ui-development.md). React Native `Button` is reserved for temporary
examples and non-product test screens.

Shared navigation, header, and startup adapters live under `src/frontend/appShell`, outside the
cross-feature component-family directory. Feature screens do not import platform UI SDKs directly.
Direct `heroui-native` and `@expo/ui` usage remains limited to capabilities whose native or
third-party behavior is itself part of the contract; a package-owned CherryUI wrapper becomes the
public surface once the app standardizes behavior around such a dependency.

Ready-for-review CI runs `pnpm ui:check-boundaries`. The check scans production TypeScript under
`src`, rejects the `@cherrystudio/ui` root and unexported deep paths, and rejects direct `@expo/ui`,
`heroui-native`, or `expo-glass-effect` imports outside a named app-shell or semantic-gateway
exemption. Inside CherryUI, it recognizes platform `*-control` and `*-frame` families, rejects their
direct re-export from an `index.ts` barrel, and requires shared props plus an extensionless fallback.
Exemptions live in the check with their architectural reason and fail when they become stale.

The check is a guardrail, not a proof of the architecture. Tests are excluded, and direct platform
families and private helpers with other names remain review-owned. It cannot prove that shared props
are consumed, that provider types do not leak, or that a platform difference is imposed rather than
chosen. The change author must state the constraint and the reviewer must apply the platform rule
above. When CherryUI adopts another platform UI SDK, add it to `platformUiPackages` in the check.

App-level singleton surfaces are owned by CherryUI, mounted once at the app root, and reached
through one hook or component from `@cherrystudio/ui/components`. Toast, portal host, and global
alert are singletons. Feature code does not import a third-party toast or dialog hook directly and
does not mount a second host for the same surface.

## Platform Responsibilities

These capabilities keep one product-facing semantic API and surrounding flow while delegating system
behavior or presentation where it differs:

| Capability | Shared responsibility | Platform responsibility |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Back navigation | destinations, headers, and page composition | iOS interactive pop and Android system or predictive back |
| Navigation chrome | titles, action semantics, icons, menu items, and page composition | how header actions and search fields render into the native navigation bar |
| Window insets | layout and spacing rules | safe-area and system-bar inset values |
| Share and pickers | trigger and surrounding product flow | share sheet, photo picker, and document picker |
| File preview | metadata, loading, error, and fallback states | Quick Look or the available Android viewer |
| System alerts and action or context menus | semantic content, actions, roles, and state | native presentation, dismissal, and gesture dispatch |
| Permissions | pre-permission explanation and denied-state recovery | the system authorization prompt |
| Haptics and accessibility | intent, labels, state, and reduced-motion behavior | supported feedback and accessibility APIs |

Top-bar actions reach the native navigation bar through `headerLeft`, `headerRight`, or
`Stack.Toolbar` with Cherry-owned content.

System back gestures are never recreated in a general-purpose horizontal swipe component. Product
gestures start outside system back-gesture edge zones, and the navigation owner handles the platform
back contract.

The target cancellation and priority rules for tap, long press, scrolling, app-defined pan, and
native text selection are defined in
[Interaction And Gesture Arbitration](./interaction-and-gesture-arbitration.md). That reference is
currently `Status: design`; existing components are not assumed to conform without verification at
their native and cross-platform interaction boundaries.

## Visual System

Color, typography, spacing, radius, elevation, opacity, and animation semantics come from the same
Cherry design system on both platforms. [Design Spec](../../DESIGN.md) owns the token pipeline and
the rules for consuming tokens. General-purpose icons come from deep `@cherrystudio/app-icons/icons/*`
imports. Provider and model brands, avatars, logos, charts, and content images remain image assets.

Platform features enhance the common interaction contract without establishing a second product
visual language. On iOS, system-rendered controls and navigation inherit the current platform
appearance, including Liquid Glass where supported: the owning platform adapter lets the system
render that material, and product code does not reproduce it.

Liquid Glass is not a product-wide visual requirement. Cherry-owned content surfaces and ordinary
product components remain shared. A custom iOS-only glass treatment is optional progressive
enhancement, while Android and unsupported iOS versions retain the same hierarchy and a complete
fallback.

## Acceptance

### Platform Boundary

Reviewable from the change itself:

- New or substantially changed ordinary product components use one visual specification and shared
  source implementation across iOS and Android by default.
- A platform-specific file names the imposed constraint — native API, lifecycle, system-rendered
  surface, provider-owned control, or bundle — that prevents a correct shared implementation.
  Familiarity and convention are not constraints.
- A platform family shares one props type and one set of helpers, kept in the family directory
  rather than restated in each platform file.
- A shared shell owns product behavior; private adapters own only platform rendering or API mapping,
  include an extensionless fallback, and are not package exports.
- Platform gateways expose one semantic API and keep SDK types out of feature code.
- `pnpm ui:check-boundaries` passes when the change touches CherryUI exports, provider imports, or a
  platform adapter family.

### Control Quality

Reviewable by running the app:

- Controls expose accessible labels, state, disabled/loading behavior, and usable touch targets.
- A committed scroll or app-defined pan cancels competing tap and long-press candidates;
  cancellation remains inert through pointer-up.
- Text scales and wraps without fixed dimensions clipping its content.
- Platform enhancement failure leaves the control recognizable and usable.
- Ambiguous icon-only actions provide an accessible label and tooltip or menu context where the
  platform supports it.
