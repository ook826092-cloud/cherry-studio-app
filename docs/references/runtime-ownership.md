# Runtime Ownership

This reference defines ownership for long-lived resources, startup work, caller-owned sessions, and
cleanup.
Terms follow [Domain Language](./domain-language.md).

## Role Names

Name an owner by who calls it and who controls its lifetime. A class that directly corresponds to a
Cherry Desktop service keeps the upstream `XxxService` name and public methods. This includes
`DbService`, `CacheService`, `PreferenceService`, persistence services, `DataApiService`,
`AiService`, `McpRuntimeService`, and `WebSearchService`.

Use these roles for mobile-owned code:

| Role | Use when the type is | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Module` | A frontend-visible workflow capability exposed through `Backend` | `ChatModule` |
| `Runtime` | One app- or bootstrap-owned executor whose state spans calls or routes | `ChatRuntime` |
| `Session` | One caller-owned isolated unit with explicit cancellation or disposal | `PaintingGenerationSession` |
| `Client` | A boundary to one external account, protocol, or remote API | `VertexAuthClient` |
| `Adapter` | A translation boundary for a platform or SDK; a precise capability noun may stand alone | `DevicePermissions` |
| `Manager` | A coordinator whose defining job is owning a homogeneous pool or registry | `ConnectionManager` |

`Backend`, `BackendProvider`, and `useBackendModule()` are intentional aggregate and React
integration names. Leaf workflows use `XxxModule`; do not add parallel `XxxBackend`, `XxxService`,
and `XxxImpl` layers for the same operations. Factory-shaped modules use `createXxxModule()`.

An app-owned runtime is created once by bootstrap and is not disposed by route or component
unmount. A caller-owned session exposes its own lifecycle. Use `Manager` only for a real pool or
registry; otherwise prefer a precise domain noun or a plain function. Do not use the `Impl` suffix.

## Principles

- Mobile adopts the desktop lifecycle framework, service registry, and a mobile-specific phase pair;
  see [Lifecycle](./lifecycle/README.md). `ApplicationHost` owns each service generation while
  bootstrap remains the composition and installation boundary.
- A runtime owner exists only for state or resources that outlive one call.
- Every owner defines creation, disposal, and abort behavior.
- Backgrounding is not a reliable execution window for chat or painting generation.
- Backend modules report events/results; frontend owners perform navigation, translation, toast,
  and React Query invalidation.

## App Bootstrap

Bootstrap has three internal owners: `preboot` performs ordered global runtime patches,
`composition` constructs and connects concrete backend implementations, and `runtime` owns
initialization, the startup gate, post-ready work, and disposal. Apart from the explicit preboot
side-effect imports in the root layout, ordinary app code uses only `src/bootstrap/index.ts`.

`AppBootstrapProvider` owns one `AppBootstrapRuntime`. The production runtime:

- creates an `ApplicationHost` and configures its platform-facing activity environment;
- creates one stable workflow `Backend`, `ApiClient`, and `PreferenceClient`;
- installs the host, whose dependency graph initializes cache before SQLite seeding and preferences,
  then waits for the native splash handoff before applying boot theme and i18n;
- starts best-effort post-ready tasks after the gate opens;
- uninstalls the host on unmount; reverse dependency order drains consumers before their
  infrastructure.

The provider's own React context exposes only `loading`, `ready`, or `error`. Concrete backend
services never enter React state or frontend code. Its children receive three stable, narrow
providers: `DataApiProvider` for typed resource endpoints, `PreferenceProvider` for preferences, and
`BackendProvider` for workflow modules, including any caller-owned session factories.

`AppBootstrapGate` is the only initial-render gate. It renders `null` while loading and throws the
initialization error. The root layout retains the native splash, while the app-shell
`StartupCoordinator` hides it only after its matching React Native cover has laid out and crossed
two composited frames. The provider owns initialization state and post-ready work; it does not own
splash visibility. `startupCoverHandoff` prevents Uniwind's native appearance synchronization from
running until the native surface is gone.

## Query Runtime

`QueryProvider` owns the React Query client and maps React Native `AppState` to query focus. It does
not own SQLite, AI streams, or backend implementation classes. Endpoint hooks call the injected
`ApiClient`; query keys and invalidation remain in frontend owners. `useBackendModule` is reserved
for workflows that are not ordinary resource queries or mutations.

## Chat Runtime

The service registry creates one `ChatRuntime` per `ApplicationHost` generation and composition
exposes its narrow `ChatModule` interface through `Backend.chat`. The runtime is app-owned, not
route-owned: `ChatProvider` subscribes on mount and unsubscribes on unmount, but it never creates or
disposes a backend object. Route unmount therefore does not terminate an active turn, and a later
subscription reads the current snapshot.

The runtime owns active turn state, AbortControllers, assistant placeholder identity, stream
reading, terminal persistence, and `ChatEvent` fan-out. It tracks turns by Topic: different Topics
may stream concurrently, while a second turn for the same Topic is rejected. New-topic reservation
uses `NEW_TOPIC_SNAPSHOT_KEY` until the persisted Topic id is available.

The frontend `ChatProvider` owns route navigation and React Query invalidation. `useChatTopic()`
projects one Topic snapshot and sends or aborts work through the shared module. Backend code never
imports Expo Router or TanStack Query.

User abort affects only the selected Topic and persists the defined paused/partial state. App
shutdown marks the runtime disposed, rejects new tasks, aborts all active turns, and waits for every
tracked task to settle before MCP, web search, cache, or SQLite is closed. An active stream is still
not guaranteed to continue, checkpoint, or resume after OS suspension or termination.

## Painting Generation

`PaintingsModule.startGeneration()` atomically creates the receipt and enqueues a
`painting.generate` row. The host-owned `JobRuntime` claims and executes it, owns cancellation and
terminal persistence, and can continue after the initiating route unmounts. The handler owns file
preparation, AI generation, output persistence, failed-output cleanup, and its feature-specific
background Activity session.

`usePaintingGeneration` owns only screen state, polling, toast/query synchronization, and the
receipt currently shown by that route. Returning to a receipt adopts its active job from the durable
ledger. Explicit cancel reaches `JobRuntime.cancel()` and then deletes the receipt; deleting a
painting through any Data API caller first fences its scope and drains the job.

## Other Long-Lived Resources

- `McpRuntimeService` owns MCP clients and tool caches; the host stops it.
- `WebSearchService` owns API-key rotation state; the host stops it.
- Backend `CacheService` owns Provider API-key rotation state and backend-only MMKV persistence;
  the host initializes and stops it.
- Frontend cache owns subscriptions and MMKV-backed UI persistence.
- Screen and component listeners, timers, and native sessions remain with their React owner.

## Startup Work

`initializeAppRuntime()` reads cached boot preferences, waits for the native-to-React cover handoff,
then applies the frontend theme and initializes i18n. It must not refresh catalogs, prefetch history,
repair data, or run diagnostics.

`runPostReadyTasks()` starts after status becomes `ready`. It repairs crash-orphaned pending
assistant messages while the host's PostReady phase prewarms MCP and starts the job cold-start pump.
Both are off the first-paint path. Host-owned PostReady initialization is retained and awaited if
that generation is disposed before it finishes.

Current topic, message history windows, provider queries, and feature state load at route level after
the bootstrap gate.

## Acceptance

- App bootstrap unmount closes SQLite and disposes long-lived backend resources.
- Route unmount only unsubscribes from Chat; app disposal aborts and awaits all Chat turns before
  closing infrastructure.
- Painting route unmount does not stop generation; explicit cancel or resource deletion reaches the
  host-owned job runtime.
- Cold start does not wait for non-current history, provider/model refresh, or diagnostics.
- Every new long-lived resource can identify its owner, release point, and background behavior.
