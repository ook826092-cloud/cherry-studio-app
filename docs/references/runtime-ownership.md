# Runtime Ownership

This reference defines ownership for long-lived resources, startup work, sessions, and cleanup.
Terms follow [Domain Language](./domain-language.md).

## Principles

- Mobile does not port the desktop lifecycle framework, service registry, or phase graph.
- A runtime owner exists only for state or resources that outlive one call.
- Every owner defines creation, disposal, and abort behavior.
- Backgrounding is not a reliable execution window for chat or painting generation.
- Backend sessions report events/results; frontend owners perform navigation, translation, toast,
  and React Query invalidation.

## App Bootstrap

Bootstrap has three internal owners: `preboot` performs ordered global runtime patches,
`composition` constructs and connects concrete backend implementations, and `runtime` owns
initialization, the startup gate, post-ready work, and disposal. Apart from the explicit preboot
side-effect imports in the root layout, ordinary app code uses only `src/bootstrap/index.ts`.

`AppBootstrapProvider` owns one `AppBootstrapRuntime`. The production runtime:

- creates `CacheService`, `DbService`, and the private backend service graph;
- creates one stable workflow `Backend`, `ApiClient`, and `PreferenceClient`;
- initializes the backend cache before SQLite seeding, then preferences, boot theme, and i18n;
- starts best-effort post-ready tasks after the gate opens;
- disposes MCP, web-search state, the backend cache, and SQLite on unmount.

The provider's own React context exposes only `loading`, `ready`, or `error`. Concrete backend
services never enter React state or frontend code. Its children receive three stable, narrow
providers: `DataApiProvider` for typed resource endpoints, `PreferenceProvider` for preferences, and
`BackendProvider` for workflow modules and sessions.

`AppBootstrapGate` is the only initial-render gate. It renders `null` while loading and throws the
initialization error. The root layout retains the native splash, and `AppBootstrapProvider` hides it
when initialization settles, including the error path.

## Query Runtime

`QueryProvider` owns the React Query client and maps React Native `AppState` to query focus. It does
not own SQLite, AI streams, or backend implementation classes. Endpoint hooks call the injected
`ApiClient`; query keys and invalidation remain in frontend owners. `useBackendModule` is reserved
for workflows that are not ordinary resource queries or mutations.

## Chat Session

`ChatSessionProvider` owns one backend `ChatSession` for the route and disposes it on unmount. The
session interface supports subscription, snapshots, sending, tool approval, abort, and disposal.

The backend session owns active turn state, AbortControllers, assistant placeholder identity,
stream reading, terminal persistence, and session events. The frontend provider owns session
subscription, route navigation, and React Query invalidation. Backend code never imports Expo Router
or TanStack Query.

An active stream is not guaranteed to continue, checkpoint, or resume after OS suspension or
termination. User abort persists the defined paused/partial state; disposal aborts active work.

## Painting Session

`usePaintingGeneration` owns a backend `PaintingGenerationSession`, an AbortController, and UI-only
generating/revealing/error state. The backend session owns file preparation, AI generation,
persistence, incomplete receipt retry state, and failed-output cleanup. The frontend hook owns toast
and query synchronization and disposes the session on unmount.

## Other Long-Lived Resources

- `McpRuntimeService` owns MCP clients and tool caches; app bootstrap disposes it.
- `WebSearchService` owns API-key rotation state; app bootstrap disposes it.
- Backend `CacheService` owns Provider API-key rotation state and backend-only MMKV persistence;
  app bootstrap initializes and disposes it.
- Frontend cache owns subscriptions and MMKV-backed UI persistence.
- Screen and component listeners, timers, and native sessions remain with their React owner.

## Startup Work

`initializeAppRuntime()` reads cached boot preferences, applies the frontend theme, and initializes
i18n. It must not refresh catalogs, prefetch history, repair data, or run diagnostics.

`runPostReadyTasks()` starts after status becomes `ready`. It currently repairs crash-orphaned
pending assistant messages and prewarms active MCP servers. It is fire-and-forget, best-effort, and
must not block first paint.

Current topic, message history windows, provider queries, and feature state load at route level after
the bootstrap gate.

## Acceptance

- App bootstrap unmount closes SQLite and disposes long-lived backend resources.
- Chat and painting owners abort active work and dispose their backend sessions.
- Cold start does not wait for non-current history, provider/model refresh, or diagnostics.
- Every new long-lived resource can identify its owner, release point, and background behavior.
