# Testing And CI

This guide defines the focused development loop, test-value rules, local pull request gates, and
the remote CI boundary.

## Test The Owned Behavior

- Put a test at the lowest layer that owns the behavior. Prefer pure functions and hooks over
  reasserting the same behavior through a screen.
- A test must fail when its protected behavior regresses and remain stable across unrelated
  implementation changes.
- Do not write tests whose only claim is that a wrapper forwards props, a component renders without
  throwing, or an implementation collaborator was called.
- A mock interaction is valid when the interaction itself is the observable contract, such as a
  transaction boundary, request shape, callback order, cancellation, subscription, or cleanup.
- Do not add screen-level render suites. Exercise screen workflows on a device with `agent-device`;
  test their pure logic and hooks directly.
- Always cover database schemas and migrations, serialized contracts, upstream patch guards, and a
  regression that reproduces a bug being fixed.
- Remove a test only when it protects no behavior. If a valuable test is slow, change how it runs.

## Focused Development Loop

Format and lint only the files being changed:

```bash
pnpm exec oxfmt --no-error-on-unmatched-pattern <files...>
pnpm exec oxlint <files...>
pnpm exec expo lint <files...>
```

Run every fixed suite that protects the changed behavior, including relevant suites whose files were
not edited:

```bash
pnpm test:app -- path/to/file.test.ts --runInBand
pnpm --filter @cherrystudio/ai-runtime test src/path/to/file.test.ts
```

Use the owning package filter for `ai-core`, `ai-runtime`, `ai-sdk-provider`, and
`provider-registry`. Jest owns app tests; package scripts select their package test runner.

Run only the specialized contract checks triggered by the change. Examples include
`pnpm docs:check-links`, `pnpm skills:check`, `pnpm design:check`, database migration checks, and
desktop synchronization guards.

### Platform Component Families

Tests mirror the ownership boundary described in
[UI Components](../references/ui-components.md#component-family-anatomy):

- Shared public-component tests mock the extensionless private adapter and assert behavior owned by
  the shared shell.
- Adapter tests import the explicit `.ios` or `.android` file so the test does not depend on Jest's
  active platform resolution.
- Fallback tests load the exact extensionless file, including its source extension when necessary,
  so an iOS-default resolver cannot silently substitute the iOS adapter.
- Fallback assertions may use a dedicated `*-control.test.tsx` file or remain beside the shell test
  while a family is small, but they load the fallback explicitly and stay grouped by their owner.
- Provider SDKs are mocked only in adapter or fallback tests. Assertions target the shared contract
  mapping, not provider implementation details.

Run `pnpm ui:check-boundaries` when changing CherryUI exports, direct provider imports, or a private
platform adapter family.

## Before Creating A Draft PR

Run these full local gates on the final local head:

```bash
pnpm lint
pnpm format:check
pnpm typecheck
```

Also rerun the behavior-related fixed suites and specialized checks selected above. Do not run the
full local `pnpm test`; remote PR CI owns the application/package suite. The local-only tooling
suites described below still run as focused checks when their behavior changes.

### After Changing Dependencies

Adding or removing a package makes pnpm rewrite the whole peer graph, which duplicates packages that
were previously shared. Two copies of `expo` is enough to break Jest on its own: the copy `jest-expo`
initializes defines `globalThis.expo`, so the other copy dials a non-existent dev server from
`Expo.fx`, and the native-module mocks in `jest.setup.ts` stop matching the paths suites resolve.

Collapse the duplicates before pushing, then rerun the gates:

```bash
pnpm dedupe
```

This is not a one-time cleanup — every dependency change re-splits the graph, so it belongs to the
same commit as the change itself.

## Ready For Review

Pull requests start as drafts. If the draft changed after its local gates, rerun the gates on the
final head before marking it ready. [PR CI](../../.github/workflows/pr-ci.yml) runs the configured
application/package tests, typecheck, lint, format, package build, UI-boundary, skill, and documentation
link checks for non-draft PRs targeting `v0.2`.

### Remote Coverage And Local Exceptions

- Root `pnpm test` builds workspace packages, runs the `ai-core`, `ai-runtime`, and
  `ai-sdk-provider` package suites, then root Jest.
- Root Jest includes `provider-registry` suites through `vitestJestShim.ts`. There is no root
  `test:provider-registry` script; use the owning package filter for a focused local run.
- With `PRCI` set, Jest excludes all `scripts/__tests__/` suites, including desktop-sync audit
  fixtures and instruction-tooling regressions. Run the affected tooling suites locally without
  `PRCI` when changing those tools; remote success does not cover them.
- `skills:check` checks public skill entry points, whitelist files, and Claude symlinks.
  `docs:check-links` checks relative file links in project docs, the
  [Project Skills usage rules](../../.agents/skills/README.md), and public skill Markdown, including
  linked skill prerequisites. One exact optional upstream reference is exempted as documented in
  those usage rules; other missing links fail. The check does not validate Markdown anchors, remote
  URLs, or dependencies mentioned only as plain text. Declare required local skill dependencies as
  Markdown links in the project usage rules without editing upstream skill files.

A PR is merge-ready only after its remote checks pass.
